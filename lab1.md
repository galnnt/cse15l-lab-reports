## CSE 15L Lab Report 1

# First Command: cd
1. Without Args\
![Image](images/cd1.png)
The working directory was /home/lectures when I ran the command. There were no errors in the output. cd with no arguments changes the directory to the home directory. This is probably because cd with no arguments changes the directory to the default directory, which in my system is just the home directory.
2. Directory Arg\
![Image](images/cd2.png)
The working directory was /home when I ran the command. There were no errors in the output. cd with a directory argument changes the directory to the input directory if it exists within the working directory. In this case there were no errors because lecture1 is a directory in the home directory so cd just changes the working directory to lecture1.
3. File Arg\
![Image](images/cd3.png)\
The working directory was /home/lecture when I ran the command. There was an error in the output as I am trying to change the directory into a file, which is not possible as a file is not a directory.


# Second Command: ls
1. Without Args\
